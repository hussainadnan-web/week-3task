# Week 3: Task Management App (Final Project) ✅

This repository contains the final submission for **Week 3**, creating a fully functional **Task Management App**. This project combines state management, local storage, and UI enhancements into a polished application.

 Learning Objectives
- Combine learned concepts into a complete functional app.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- UI Enhancements using custom AppBars and Icons.
- Debugging and Testing navigation and data persistence.

Features

### 1. Task Management (Core Functionality)
- **View Tasks:** A home screen displaying a scrollable list of all tasks.
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks via a custom Action Button.
- **Mark as Complete:** Toggle tasks as "Done" or "Pending" (e.g., using a checkbox).
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove unwanted tasks from the list.

### 2. Data Persistence 💾
- Uses `shared_preferences` to save the task list locally.
- Data persists even after the app is closed and restarted.

### 3. UI Enhancements 🎨
- **Custom App Bar:** Features a custom title and actions.
- **Visual Appeal:** Uses Flutter's `Icons` library (e.g., Delete icon, Check icon) for a better user experience.
